<h1>An objective ranking of various forms of media according to me</h1>
<h2>Top three best movies</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Tangled</h3>
<p>Cool setting and story</p>

<h3>Wreck-it-Ralph</h3>
<p>Really nice premise</p>

<h3>Metal Gear Solid: Philanthropy</h3>
<p>Really obscure low budget movie, but well worth a watch.</p>
